# RIS UI

**Component library for NeuRIS** | ðŸ‘€ [Demo](https://digitalservicebund.github.io/ris-ui) | ðŸ“¦ [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@digitalservicebund/ris-ui) | ðŸ¤– [PrimeVue Docs](https://primevue.org)

## Installation

RIS UI contains three things:

- a [theme](./src/primevue/) for [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) components from [PrimeVue 4](https://primevue.org);
- [custom components](./src/components/);
- a [configuration](./src/tailwind/global.css) file for [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) that includes design tokens, typography, and global component styles, ensuring consistency across custom UI and PrimeVue components.

Vue, PrimeVue and Tailwind are required for RIS UI to work (you'll see a warning about missing peer dependencies if you're trying to use RIS UI without them). To get started, install:

```sh
# Vue, PrimeVue, and Tailwind if you haven't installed them already
npm install vue primevue tailwindcss

# RIS UI
npm install @digitalservicebund/ris-ui
```

### Vue (SPA with Vite, Vue CLI or similar)

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you're using Nuxt, follow the instructions for [Nuxt](#nuxt-setup) below instead.

Import and apply the RIS UI theme and fonts where you set up your application (typically `main.ts`):

```diff
  // main.ts
  import { createApp } from "vue";
  import PrimeVue from "primevue/config";
+ import { RisUiTheme, RisUiLocale } from "@digitalservicebund/ris-ui/primevue";
+ import "@digitalservicebund/ris-ui/fonts.css";

  const app = createApp().use(PrimeVue, {
+   unstyled: true,
+   pt: RisUiTheme,
+   locale: RisUiLocale.deDE
  })
```

Then, extend your Tailwind configuration for RIS UI:

```diff
  /* import Tailwind and RIS UI styles */
  @import "tailwindcss";
+ @import "@digitalservicebund/ris-ui/style.css";

+ /* source the RIS UI components for Tailwind class generation */
+ @source "../node_modules/@digitalservicebund/ris-ui/dist/**/*.{js,vue,ts}";

  /* other config and styles */
```

### Nuxt setup

If using Nuxt, skip the Vue setup above.

Install the Nuxt PrimeVue module:

```sh
npm install @primevue/nuxt-module
```

Add the PrimeVue module and configure it in `nuxt.config.ts`:

```diff
  // nuxt.config.ts
+ import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";
  export default defineNuxtConfig({
    // your other configuration
    modules: [
+     "@primevue/nuxt-module",
    ],
+   primevue: {
+      usePrimeVue: false, // configured in plugins/ris-ui.ts
+   },
    vite: {
      plugins: [
+       tailwindcss(),
      ],
    }
  })
```

Add a new Nuxt plugin to configure PrimeVue:

```typescript
// plugins/ris-ui.ts
import { RisUiTheme, RisUiLocale } from "@digitalservicebund/ris-ui/primevue";
import PrimeVue from "primevue/config";

export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  nuxtApp.vueApp.use(PrimeVue, {
    pt: RisUiTheme,
    unstyled: true,
    locale: RisUiLocale.deDE,
  });
});
```

Continue with the next step, _Tailwind CSS Configuration_.

## Getting started

To get you started, here's an example how to use a RIS UI button in your ui component. The Storybook code snippet is hiding some essential parts from you. Here is an an example `StartPage.vue`:

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { useRouter } from "vue-router";
import Button from "primevue/button";
import IconAdd from "~icons/material-symbols/add";

const router = useRouter();
</script>

<template>
  <Button
    :disabled="false"
    :loading="false"
    :text="false"
    label="Neue Dokumentationseinheit"
    @click="router.push({ path: '/documentUnit/new' })"
  >
    <template #icon>
      <IconAdd />
    </template>
  </Button>
</template>
```

In addition to the installation steps, the icon is being provided by [unplugin-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unplugin-icons) in conjunction with [@iconify-json/material-symbols](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iconify-json/material-symbols).

## Development

To make changes to RIS UI, you'll need the current [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) along with npm installed on your machine.

To get started, first clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/digitalservicebund/ris-ui.git
```

Then install dependencies:

```sh
npm install

# This will populate the public/fonts folder. See public/fonts/.gitkeep
# for more information.
npm run sync-fonts
```

You can now run a local preview to see any changes you make to the code:

```sh
npm run storybook
```

Check out [package.json](./package.json) for additional scripts.

### Repository contents

RIS UI uses the following tools:

- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), a playground for previewing components and styling
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as our dev server and bundler
- [Unplugin Icons](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-icons) for providing SVG icons as components
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code consistency
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) as our test runner

You can find more in [package.json](./package.json), but the above are the ones you'll work with the most.

In terms of files and folders, you'll find:

| Folder           | Contents                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| (root)           | General docs and configuration            |
| `.github/`       | GitHub Actions configuration              |
| `.storybook/`    | Storybook setup                           |
| `src/components` | Custom Vue components                     |
| `src/primevue`   | The RIS UI preset for PrimeVue            |
| `src/tailwind`   | The RIS UI preset and plugin for Tailwind |
| `src/lib`        | Internal tools and helpers                |

### Tailwind IntelliSense

If you're using VS Code with the [official Tailwind extension](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup), you can get autocompletions and more by adding this to your VS Code settings:

```jsonc
{
  // other settings
  "tailwindCSS.classFunctions": ["tw"],
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.configFile": "./src/tailwind/global.css",
}
```

This will detect Tailwind CSS classes in template strings tagged with `tw` such as:

```ts
import { tw } from "@/lib/tags";

const classes = tw`bg-blue-200 px-16`;
```

See [tags.ts](./src/lib/tags.ts) for more information. A similar configuration should work for other IDEs, too.

### Committing

Before making your first commit, you'll need some additional prerequisites installed. These help us with code consistency and quality:

- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/): Used for checking the pipeline status before pushing
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/): Used by our license check, which ensures all our dependencies use [allowed licenses](./allowed-licenses.json) only
- [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook): Runs Git commit hooks
- [Talisman](https://github.com/thoughtworks/talisman): Validates you're not accidentially committing secrets

Once they're installed, run:

```sh
# In ./ris-ui
lefthook install
```

When you make a commit now, Lefthook will ensure your changes and commit message adhere to our coding guidelines:

- Code is formatted with Prettier
- ESLint passes without warnings
- The commit message follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. If you're making changes to a component, please use the component name as the scope (multiple scopes are allowed).

Keep in mind that your commit messages will be used for generating changelogs and inferring version numbers when making a release. If you made multiple changes, please consider squashing them to keep the history, as well as the changelogs, tidy and readable.

### Making a release

To release a new version, run the ["Release to npm"](https://github.com/digitalservicebund/ris-ui/actions/workflows/release.yml) action. This will:

- Build the project
- Publish the build to npm
- Create a Git tag and GitHub release
- Generate a changelog based on the commits since the last release

Releases are created automatically by [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release?tab=readme-ov-file). Please refer to their documentation to learn more about how version numbers are inferred and how changelogs are created. In short:

- If the commits since the last release only include `fix` type commits, a patch release will be created.
- If at least one `feat` type commit exists, a minor release will be created.
- [Breaking changes](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#commit-message-with-description-and-breaking-change-footer) cause a new major release.

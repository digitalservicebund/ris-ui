# RIS UI

**Component library for NeuRIS** | ðŸ‘€ [Demo](https://digitalservicebund.github.io/ris-ui) | ðŸ“¦ [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@digitalservicebund/ris-ui) | ðŸ¤– [PrimeVue Docs](https://primevue.org)

## Installation

RUI UI contains three things:

- a [theme](./src/primevue/) for [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) components from [PrimeVue 4](https://primevue.org);
- [custom components](./src/components/);
- a [preset and plugin](./src/tailwind/) for [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) that sets some global styling and exposes the design tokens used by the theme, so you can build custom UI that looks consistent with the components.

Vue, PrimeVue and Tailwind are required for RIS UI to work (you'll see a warning about missing peer dependencies if you're trying to use RIS UI without them). To get started, install:

```sh
# Vue, PrimeVue, and Tailwind if you haven't installed them already.
npm install vue primevue tailwindcss

# RIS UI
npm install @digitalservicebund/ris-ui
```

### Vue setup

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you're using Nuxt, follow the instructions for [Nuxt](#nuxt-setup) below instead.

Import and apply the RIS UI theme, styling, and fonts where you set up your application (typically `main.ts`):

```diff
  // main.ts
  import { createApp } from "vue";
  import PrimeVue from "primevue/config";
+ import { RisUiTheme, RisUiLocale } from "@digitalservicebund/ris-ui/primevue";
+ import "@digitalservicebund/ris-ui/fonts.css";
+ import "@digitalservicebund/ris-ui/primevue/style.css"

  const app = createApp().use(PrimeVue, {
+   unstyled: true,
+   pt: RisUiTheme,
+   locale: RisUiLocale.deDE
  })
```

### Nuxt setup

If using Nuxt, skip the Vue setup above.

Install the Nuxt PrimeVue module:

```sh
npm install @primevue/nuxt-module
```

Add the PrimeVue module and configure it in `nuxt.config.ts`:

```diff
  // nuxt.config.ts
  export default defineNuxtConfig({
    // your other configuration
    modules: [
+     "@primevue/nuxt-module",
    ],
+   primevue: {
+      usePrimeVue: false, // configured in plugins/ris-ui.ts
+   },
  })
```

Add a new Nuxt plugin to configure PrimeVue:

```typescript
// plugins/ris-ui.ts
import { RisUiTheme } from "@digitalservicebund/ris-ui/primevue";
import PrimeVue from "primevue/config";

export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  nuxtApp.vueApp.use(PrimeVue, {
    pt: RisUiTheme,
    unstyled: true,
  });
});
```

Finally, add the styles (e.g. `assets/main.css`):

```css
@import "@digitalservicebund/ris-ui/primevue/style.css";
@import "@digitalservicebund/ris-ui/fonts.css";

/* Your other CSS */
```

## Tailwind setup

- Add the `RisUiPreset` (for colors, spacings, etc.) and the `RisUiPlugin` (for typography classes, etc.)
- Ensure the path to the RIS-UI files is included in the content array of your Tailwind config (e.g., `"./node_modules/@digitalservicebund/ris-ui/dist/**/*.{js,vue,ts}"`). This ensures all necessary classes from RIS UI are generated.

```diff
  // tailwind.config.js
+ import { RisUiPreset, RisUiPlugin } from "@digitalservicebund/ris-ui/tailwind";

  export default {
  content: [
+    "./node_modules/@digitalservicebund/ris-ui/dist/**/*.{js,vue,ts}",
    // Other content sources
  ],

+   presets: [RisUiPreset],
+   plugins: [RisUiPlugin],

    // your other configuration
  };
```

Ensure Tailwind is included in your main stylesheet (e.g., `style.css`):

```diff
// style.css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Important Note for Nuxt Projects

To avoid issues with conflicting `@layer` directives, make sure to integrate the `postcss-import` module in your PostCSS configuration:

See [Adding custom styles - Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-multiple-css-files).

If you're using Nuxt, you may add the `postcss-import` module to your `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```diff
  // nuxt.config.ts
  postcss: {
    plugins: {
+     "postcss-import": {},
      tailwindcss: {},
      autoprefixer: {},
    },
  },
```

## Get started with a button

To get you started, here's an example how to import a ris-ui button into your ui-component. The Storybook code snippet is hiding some essential parts from you. Here is an an example `StartPage.vue`:

```bash
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { useRouter } from 'vue-router'
import Button from 'primevue/button'
import IconAdd from '~icons/material-symbols/add'

const router = useRouter()
</script>

<template>
  <Button
    :disabled="false"
    label="Neue Dokumentationseinheit"
    :loading="false"
    :text="false"
    @click="router.push({ path: '/documentUnit/new' })"
  >
    <template #icon>
      <IconAdd />
    </template>
  </Button>
</template>
```

In addition to the installation steps, the icon is being provided by [unplugin-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unplugin-icons) in conjunction with [@iconify-json/material-symbols](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iconify-json/material-symbols).

## Development

To make changes to RIS UI, you'll need the current [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) along with npm installed on your machine.

To get started, first clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/digitalservicebund/ris-ui.git
```

Then install dependencies:

```sh
npm install

# This will populate the public/fonts folder. See public/fonts/.gitkeep
# for more information.
npm run sync-fonts
```

You can now run a local preview to see any changes you make to the code:

```sh
npm run storybook
```

Check out [package.json](./package.json) for additional scripts.

### Repository contents

RIS UI uses the following tools:

- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), a playground for previewing components and styling
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as our dev server and bundler
- [Unplugin Icons](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-icons) for providing SVG icons as components
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code consistency
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) as our test runner

You can find more in [package.json](./package.json), but the above are the ones you'll work with the most.

In terms of files and folders, you'll find:

| Folder           | Contents                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| (root)           | General docs and configuration            |
| `.github/`       | GitHub Actions configuration              |
| `.storybook/`    | Storybook setup                           |
| `src/components` | Custom Vue components                     |
| `src/primevue`   | The RIS UI preset for PrimeVue            |
| `src/tailwind`   | The RIS UI preset and plugin for Tailwind |
| `src/lib`        | Internal tools and helpers                |

### Tailwind IntelliSense

If you're using VS Code with the [official Tailwind extension](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup), you can get autocompletions and more by adding this to your VS Code settings:

```jsonc
{
  // other settings
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": ["tw`([^`]*)`"],
}
```

This will detect Tailwind CSS classes in template strings tagged with `tw` such as:

```ts
import { tw } from "@/lib/tags";

const classes = tw`bg-blue-200 px-16`;
```

See [tags.ts](./src/lib/tags.ts) for more information.
